# Isolation or "Dont't Get Stranded" Game AI

## Rules
In this 2 player game, both players are given random initial spots which are also called safe spots. 
Each player, during his/her chance, has to move 1 space in any of the 8 possible directions. 
They cannot go on any of the already visited squares.
Both the players can go on either of the safe spots as many times as they want. 
The motive of the game is to 'ISOLATE' the opponent such that he/she has no possible square that he/she can got to.

## Algorithm
This code file works on the minimax algorithm along with alpha-beta pruning.

Heuristic Score: ( Heuristic Score is the Scoring Algorithm based on which the minimax tree works )
a * ( Number of possible moves the AI has )  -  b * ( Number of possible moves the Opponent has )
a - Higher its value, more is the AI focussed on increasing the number of possible moves the AI has
b - Higher its value, more is the AI focussed on reducing the number of possible moves the Opponent has
